### Link

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### My Approach

This project was built by React and styled with Tailwind CSS, My goal was to make it user friendly that people from different age range could use it, So I kept the UI as simple as possible.

I started the design process from the smallest (Mobile) then i moved onto bigger screens.

My first step in the development process was to identify the global states and then i set them with the help of useContext hook from React, The app has 3 states I made it in a way that components are getting rendered depending on the global state of the app.

### User Story

The user should be able to see a start quiz button which on click will change the state of the app and start a counter of 5 minutes.
The user now should be able to selecting one correct answer.
The user should be able to go to the next question once Next Question is clicked.
When the user completes answering 12 question the user should be directed to see his final result.
In case of the 5 minutes timer is up before the completion of 12 question the user should also be directed to see his final result.
Finally the user should be given an option to restart the quiz and repeat the same process again.
